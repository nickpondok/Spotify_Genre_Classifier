    "The goal of this project was to generate a music genre classifier. My goal with this project was to use audio features provided by Spotify to create a classifer that can accuratly classify the music genre. I will be taking a look at the performance of several different algorithms to see which I can get to perform best in terms of accuracy. "

    "The dataset consisted of over 50,000 songs pulled from spotify using the spotify API. The data was scrubbed to ensure the songs we had were classified into a \"normal\" genre (not one of Spotify's many niche genres such as \"in the car.\" In addition to the songs, all the audio features of the songs were pulled from Spotify as well. This included 13 features such as \"energy\", \"danceability\", and \"loudness.\" "

I did attempt to run it with a balanced weight, but the balanced model actually performed worse than the default. \n",
